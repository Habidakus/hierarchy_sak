Playing around with having a tool for converting from one hierarchical configuration file type to another.
Currently it supports:
 - JSON (read/write)
 - digraph (write)
 - simple text output (write)

Looking to add YAML, TOML, XML, and maybe some old stanza file formats.

Caveat: Not sure if it's really useful, or possible, but it's a good practice to keep my C++ skills up.
